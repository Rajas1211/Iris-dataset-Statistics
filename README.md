# Iris-dataset-Statistics

The Shiny App presents an interactive app to apply Descriptive analysis and Linear regression on various variables of Iris Data Set. The App was designed as Statistics Assignment to apply various concepts of Statistics such as Probability Distribution, Probability of Random Variable, Regression Model, Descriptive Analysis Visualization.

Below is the published link of the App:

Description:

As Iris Data gives values of naturally occuring sizes i.e. Sepal and Petal Widths and Lengths; they are assumed to be normally distributed. 
Tab 1: Displays the head of the Data.

Tab 2: Plots Histogram of the selected Attribute and Summary of the Same.

Tab 3:
Tab three allows the user to select an Attribute ( Sepal Length,Sepal Width,Petal Length or Petal Width). The App will display the range of the selected attribute i.e. lowest value and highest value.
Further the user can find probability of the any the selected Attribute being of certain value - i.e. probability of Random variable
For example: User selects Attribute: Sepal Length and Random Variable 4
The App displays probability (1) Lowest value and Highest Value of Sepal length in Dataset (Range)
                             (2) Probability of Sepal length being 4
                             (3) Probability of Sepal length being below 4
                             (4) Probability of Sepal length being above 4
                             
Tab 4:
It has got four Sub-tab
  Tab a:
  Shows scatterplot with Outcome Variable and Explanatory Variable
  Tab b:
  Shows the Frequency distribution of the two variables using Histogram
  Tab c:
  Applies linear Regression and Prints the summary
  Tab d:
  Displays the Data
